# React Router Patterns Exercise

## Description

In this exercise, students create two apps meant to expand thier react-router skillset. However, the lecture material for this unit was very outdated, disorganized, and far too brief. I did the best I could trying to learn the more modern syntax of react-router-dom on my own, but unfortunately could not finish the exercise completely in a reasonable amount of time. I do plan to revisit this exercise when I find time to dive deeper into the subject matter, as well as better resources to learn from.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository :

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SeanBailey15/react_router_patterns_exercise.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the directory :

    ```bash
    cd react_router_patterns_exercise
    ```

3. Install the dependencies :

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Run the app :

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

**The terminal window will display a ```Ctrl + click```-able link to the app*  

## Now What?

You will be presented with a home page that provides two link buttons, one to each part of the exercise. As stated above, part 2 is incomplete. Part 1 was cobbled together with what little explanation the course material provided and what I could learn from some quick and dirty research in the limited time I could afford to spend on this exercise. Please don't judge me too harshly, lol.
